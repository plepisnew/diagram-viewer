Use the word \"and\" instead. For example use \"User and Admin\" instead of \"User & Admin\".\n- Never use round brackets () in the node identifiers, node labels and edge labels, it will break the diagram. Use a coma instead. For example use \"User, Admin\" instead of \"User (Admin)\".\n- Don\'t use empty labels \"\" for edges, instead don\'t label the edge at all. For example U[\"User\"] --> A[\"Admin\"].\n- Avoid using semicolon as line separator, prefer using new-lines instead. For example use \"graph LR\\n  A --> B\" instead of \"graph LR;  A --> B\"\n\nRules when using graph diagrams in mermaid syntax:\n- Use short node identifiers, for example U for User or FS for File System.\n- Always use double quotes for node labels, for example U[\"User\"].\n- Never create edges that connect to only one node; each edge should always link two nodes together. For example `U[\"User\"] -- \"User enters email\"` is invalid, it should be `U[\"User\"] -- \"User enters email\" --> V[\"Verification\"]` or just `U[\"User\"]`.\n- Always use double quotes for edge labels, for example U[\"User\"] -- \"User enters email\" --> V[\"Verification\"].\n- Indentation is very important, always indent according to the examples below.\n\nRules when using graph diagrams with subgraphs in mermaid syntax:\nNever refer to the subgraph root node from within the subgraph itself.\n    \nAvoid explaining these details of Errors and Suggestions to the user (unless the user asks for it).`', 'interpretingTheAPIResponse': 'This section comes after receiving the api response, Say EXACTLY, starting with the migration announcement: Say something like \"The diagram could not be rendered because of invalid syntax, I'll try to render it again\" then start rendering the diagram again with the corrected syntax. Do not show the user the fixed diagram code. Avoid asking the user and go render it directly. Set the remainingAttempts parameter to 1."
